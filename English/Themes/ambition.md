[[ambition]] is the fundamental theme and the driving force of [[Macbeth]]'s life. It is also the theme (in this play) that informs the Shakespearean idea of **tragedy**. in *[[Macbeth]]* the hero's greatest weakness (causing him to fall from grace and inevitably die) is [[ambition]].

- [[Macbeth]] acknowledges his **'vaulting [[ambition]]'** ([[1.7]]) specifically when he is contemplating the murder of [[Duncan]]. This acknowledgement comes after he has considered all the good reasons for not murdering [[Duncan]] - only [[ambition]] is left to overrule [[Macbeth]]'s troubled conscience.

- Although the influence of both [[Lady Macbeth]] and the [[witches]] is strong, their power over [[Macbeth]] is only possible because his [[ambition]] is already there.

- On first meeting [[Macbeth]] we find him startled and fearful of something that sounds **'so fair**

# Lennox and a lord

Lennox outlines to another lord in deeply **ironic** terms his understanding of what has been happening in Scotland: that is, that [[Macbeth]] is responsible for all the murders that have plagued the state.

[[Malcolm]] is in the English court attempting to raise military support to reclaim his throne. Lennox supports this.

[[Macduff]] is in disgrace for refusing to attend [[Macbeth]]'s banquet and is attempting to join [[Malcolm]].

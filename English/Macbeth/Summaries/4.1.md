# The [[witches]]' prophecies

Three [[witches]] create a powerful spell and prepare to meet [[Macbeth]], Hecat joins them and approves their spell.

[[Macbeth]] then enters and commands them to answer his questions.

They call upon powerful spirits to respond to him. 

He is told three prophecies: that he should fear [[Macduff]], that he cannot be harmed by one born of a woman and that he is secure until Birnan Wood comes to Dunsinane.

He then presses them for more information about [[Banquo]]'s offspring and is shown a vision of eight kings all descended from [[Banquo]], who also appears.

The [[witches]] suddenly vanish and [[Macbeth]] curses them. Lennox appears and informs [[Macbeth]] that [[Macduff]] has fled to England.

[[Macbeth]] determines to kill [[Macduff]]'s wife and children.

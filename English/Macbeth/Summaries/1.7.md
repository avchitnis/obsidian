# Vaulting [[ambition]]

In a **soliloquy**, [[Macbeth]] debates the pros and cons of murdering [[Duncan]].

He worries that the act of murdering his king and guest will return to plague him. He admits that [[Duncan]] has been a good king and worries that heaven itself will expose his wickedness.

[[Macbeth]] says that the only justification for murder is his [[ambition]].

He is frightened by his own **imagery** of damnation and he resolves not to go ahead with the murder.

[[Lady Macbeth]] enters and [[Macbeth]] is informs her that he will not murder [[Duncan]]. He has been **'honoured'** (line 32) recently by the king and does not want to **'cast aside'** (line 35) this recognition.

[[Lady Macbeth]] is contemptuous of his change of heart and accuses him of cowardice. They argue but her violent determination wins out. She outlines the plan and he agrees to it.

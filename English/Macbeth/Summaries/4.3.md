# [[Malcolm]] and [[Macduff]]

In England, [[Malcolm]] is suspicious of [[Macduff]] and tests him by pretending to be even more evil than [[Macbeth]].

[[Macduff]]'s lament for Scotland convinces [[Malcolm]] who then retracts his confessions of evil. When he sees that [[Macduff]] is sincere and opposed to [[Macbeth]], [[Malcolm]] reveals that he has English support for invasion of Scotland.

[[Macduff]] is confused but pleased by this turn of events. A doctor appears and mentions the saintly work of King Edward the Confessor.

[[Ross]] arrives and informs [[Macduff]] that his family as been murdered.

[[Macduff]] resolves to support [[Malcolm]] and vows to kill [[Macbeth]] himself.

# Fearless [[Macbeth]]

[[Macbeth]] enters with the doctor and attendants.

He is in a fearless mood: the prophecies give him complete confidence that he is untouchable.

A servant is jeered as he reports that the English troops are arriving.

[[Macbeth]] orders his armor and asks for the doctor to cure his wife.

He dismisses the doctor's medical advice and asks him instead what would cure his country.

He scarcely listens to the doctor's reply - he is obsessed with the prophecies, which he thinks are the only things that will guarantee his security.

# [[Lady Macbeth]]'s sleep walking

In [[Macbeth]]'s castle at Dunsinane a doctor and a gentlewoman discuss their patient, [[Lady Macbeth]].

The gentlewoman refuses to discuss what she has heard [[Lady Macbeth]] say in her sleep, since she has no witness to back up her statements.

As the doctor attempts to persuade her, [[Lady Macbeth]] appears, walking in her sleep.

They both hear her reveal her guilt and watch her futile attempts to remove the blood from her hands.

The doctor concludes that she is in need of spiritual rather than medical attention.

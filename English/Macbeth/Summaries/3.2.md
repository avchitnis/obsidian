# Snakes and scorpions

[[Lady Macbeth]] wants to speak to her husband before the feast. She is on edge - uncertainty and insecurity trouble them both.

[[Macbeth]] appears and she scolds him both for staying alone and for his continued dwelling on their actions.

They discuss the feast ahead, resolve to praise [[Banquo]] at it, and then [[Macbeth]] reveals his fear of [[Banquo]] and Fleance.

He reveals that he intends to commit another dreadful crime. He will not tell [[Lady Macbeth]] what it is, but asks her to praise it when it is achieved.

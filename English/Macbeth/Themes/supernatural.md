The theme of the [[supernatural]] appears in the play in various guises - as the [[witches]], as visions and in [[Lady Macbeth]]'s incantations.

- Witchcraft has four functions in the play: it exposes the evil hiding within [[Macbeth]]; it directs his evil to particular deeds; it highlights the forces of evil at work in the world; and it creates a powerful atmosphere in the play.

- The [[witches]] only appear in four scenes ([[1.1]], [[1.3]], [[3.5]], [[4.1]]). However, they are the first characters we meet and their evil sets the scene for everything to come: thunder and lightning suggest the havoc that Scotland is about to experience. The [[witches]] know they will tell [[Macbeth]] something that will prey on his mind. The [[witches]]' knowledge is like a drug to [[Macbeth]]. He is hooked on them from the start - **'would they had stayed'** ([[1.3]]) - and continually wants more. This leads him to seek them out later. [[Banquo]] warns against trusting [[supernatural]] knowledge, but [[Macbeth]] will not listen.

- [[Macbeth]] is particularly affected by the [[supernatural]], with his visions of the dagger ([[2.1]]) and [[Banquo]]'s ghost ([[3.4]]).

- When [[Lady Macbeth]] calls on the dark forces ([[1.5]]) she is asking demonic spirits to possess her mind and body so that all human pity can be removed.

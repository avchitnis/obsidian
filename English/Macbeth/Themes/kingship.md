The theme of [[kingship]] is important and the play presents examples of good and bad rule in the form of [[Duncan]] and [[Macbeth]].

- [[Duncan]] is presented as a just and fair king. He rewards his men with honours and makes [[Macbeth]] Thane of Cawdor.

- When [[Macbeth]] contemplates killing [[Duncan]] in [[1.7]] he lists [[Duncan]]'s virtues.

- [[Macbeth]] comes to be king through immoral means and his rule continues in this way.

- When [[Duncan]] is fair, [[Macbeth]] is tyrannical and becomes murderous. His rule is a brutal dictatorship.

- Edward is King of England and, in contrast to [[Macbeth]], is portrayed as a good king, well - liked by his people.

- [[Malcolm]], [[Duncan]]'s son, is crowned King at the end of the play.

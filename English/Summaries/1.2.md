# Brave [[Macbeth]]

King [[Duncan]] receives news that the battle against the rebel Macdonwald was evenly balanced, but that [[Macbeth]] killed him.

The Captain brings news to [[Duncan]] that, thanks to [[Macbeth]]'s and [[Banquo]]'s courageous actions, his army has won.

[[Duncan]] then declares that the traitorous Thane of Cawdor will be executed and bestows his title and lands on [[Macbeth]] as a reward.

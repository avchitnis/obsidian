# [[Duncan]] is discovered

The knocking from the previous scene continues and the Porter goes to open the gate. He imagines he is the porter of Hell. He lets [[Macduff]] and Lennox in.

Pretending to be awoken by the knocking, [[Macbeth]] arrives to greet them. [[Macduff]] asks to be led to the king.

[[Macduff]] discovers the murder and returns, proclaiming treason. As [[Macduff]] calls the alarm, [[Macbeth]] and Lennox rush in to see [[Duncan]].

[[Lady Macbeth]] appears, then [[Banquo]]. Both are informed of the murder.

[[Macbeth]] returns and bemoans the dreadful deed. Lennox suggests the guards may have been responsible and [[Macbeth]] confesses that he killed them.

[[Macduff]] questions this action and [[Macbeth]] proclaims his love for [[Duncan]]. [[Lady Macbeth]] faints, distracting attention.

[[Banquo]] says they must question the murder. [[Malcolm]] and Donalbain decide to flee, suspecting treachery from someone closely related.

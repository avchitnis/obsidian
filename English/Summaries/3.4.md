# [[Banquo]]'s ghost

[[Macbeth]] welcomes various guests to his banquet.

The first murderer appears and [[Macbeth]] steps aside to speak with him. The murderer tells [[Macbeth]] that [[Banquo]] is dead, but that Fleance escaped.

[[Macbeth]] is disturbed. He returns to the feast and is gently reprimanded by his wife for his absence.

He stands to raise a toast in praise of [[Banquo]]. As he does so, [[Banquo]]'s ghost enters and sits in his place.

Only [[Macbeth]] can see the ghost and [[Macbeth]] is terrified. [[Lady Macbeth]] says her husband often has these fits. Her quick thinking covers up for [[Macbeth]] as he begins to reveal his guilt.

The ghost disappears and [[Macbeth]] regains his composure. Once more he tries to seem cheerful and praises **'our dearest friend [[Banquo]]'** (line 89). Then the ghost reappears and [[Macbeth]] loses his nerve altogether.

He recovers when the ghost disappears again, but too late for the banquet to continue. [[Lady Macbeth]] dismisses everyone.

Alone with his wife, [[Macbeth]] says he thinks [[Macduff]] is against him. He reveals that he has spies in his lords' houses. He tells her that he intends to revisit the [[witches]].

Three [[witches]] meet in the middle of a storm.

They speak in riddles and rhymes, using strange language such as **'hurly-burly** (line 3).

They are preparing to entice [[Macbeth]] **'upon the heath'** (line 6).

A sense of foreboding is created by their **choral** lines that set up the theme of deception where **'Fair is foul, and foul is fair'** (line 9).

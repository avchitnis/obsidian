# [[Malcolm]] to be king

King [[Duncan]] asks his son, [[Malcolm]] to confirm that the Thane of Cawdor has been executed.

He is told that Cawdor died with dignity, repenting his actions.

[[Macbeth]] and [[Banquo]] enter and are thanked by [[Duncan]] for their efforts in the war.

[[Duncan]] proclaims that [[Malcolm]] will be his heir. He also says that he will visit [[Macbeth]] at home.

[[Macbeth]] says he will write to his wife and prepare for the arrival of the king. He is unhappy about [[Duncan]]'s announcement that [[Malcolm]] is next in line to the throne.

In [[Macbeth]]'s absence, [[Duncan]] praises him to [[Banquo]].

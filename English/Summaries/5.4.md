# Great Birnan Wood rises

[[Malcolm]] orders his men to each cut down a bough from Birnan Wood and to carry it in front of them to conceal their numbers from [[Macbeth]].

They learn that [[Macbeth]] intends to remain in Dunsinane, his strategy being to endure a siege.

This is his only hope, since his troops are demoralised and fight for him out of necessity, not commitment.

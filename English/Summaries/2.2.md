[[Lady Macbeth]]'s nerves are on edge as she awaits for [[Macbeth]] to return from committing the murder. Her mood is bold, and she boasts about how she has drugged the guards.

[[Macbeth]] enters, carrying two bloodstained daggers. He is obsessed by the noises of laughter and crying that he had heard.

[[Macbeth]]'s guilt torments him. [[Lady Macbeth]] attempts to lessen and rationalise his fears.

She then criticises [[Macbeth]] for failing to leave the daggers on the guards. She has to go back herself and plant the weapons on them - [[Macbeth]] is too frightened.

A knocking at the gate means they must quickly go to bed and pretend to be suprised when [[Duncan]]'s body is discovered.

[[Lady Macbeth]] reads a letter from her husband describing his encounter with the [[witches]].

She is convinced by the [[witches]]'s prophecy because, as they promised, [[Macbeth]] has been made Thane of Cawdor.

She worries that [[Macbeth]] is too kind-natured to be able to take the crown. She is determined that she will assist him through **'the valour of my tongue'** (line 26).

[[Lady Macbeth]] is overjoyed to learn that [[Duncan]] will stay in their castle overnight. She calls on demonic spirits to harden her resolve and to destroy any weakness or pity.

[[Macbeth]] enters and she starts convincing him that he should murder [[Duncan]].

She insists that the deed must be done, that she will personally organise its operation, and finally that failure to accomplish it would be a form of fear.

The [[witches]] meet as planned, in thunder and rain.

They greet [[Macbeth]] and [[Banquo]] and tell them that [[Macbeth]] will become both Thane of Cawdor and King of Scotland.

[[Macbeth]] is stunned by these prophecies. Banquo demands the [[witches]] tell him of his future too. They predict that he will not be king, but his offspring will.

The [[witches]] vanish and messengers from King [[Duncan]] arrive. They report that [[Macbeth]] is now Thane of Cawdor.

[[Macbeth]] is astonished by the news and [[Banquo]] warns him of danger. [[Macbeth]] is preoccupied by thoughts of [[kingship]], which he tries to hide.

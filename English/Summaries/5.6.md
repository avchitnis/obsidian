# The final downfall of [[Macbeth]]

[[Malcolm]], [[Macduff]] and Seyward, with their armies camouflaged, approach [[Macbeth]]'s castle. Battle commences.

[[Macbeth]] kills Young Seyward in combat. He is trapped but unbeaten, even though his army has fallen.

[[Macbeth]] encounters [[Macduff]], who reveals that he was not 'born' or woman (line 13), but delivered by Caesarean (lines 15 - 16). In a final act of courage, [[Macbeth]] fights [[Macduff]] and is killed.

On his way to bed, [[Banquo]] has a premonition something is wrong, and then encounters [[Macbeth]].

[[Banquo]] presents him with a gift from the king: a diamond for [[Lady Macbeth]].

[[Banquo]] tells [[Macbeth]] that he dreamt of the [[witches]]. [[Macbeth]] says he does not think of them, but asks that he and [[Banquo]] speak about the matter another time.

[[Macbeth]] is left alone and imagines he sees a dagger in front of him - a dagger that guides him towards his goal of killing [[Duncan]].

As the bell rings, he determines to go ahead and murder the king.
